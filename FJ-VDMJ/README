Building VDMJ

VDMJ is designed to be built with Maven (see http://maven.apache.org/).

In practice, after checking out the source, this means you just need to sit at the root
directory (where the pom.xml file is located) and run the command "mvn install". This
will build the VDMJ jar file in the target folder, as well as running the internal test
suite.

To prepare VDMJ for work with Eclipse, the command "mvn eclipse:eclipse" from the top
level folder will build an Eclipse project file and allow the project to be imported.
Alternatively, the Eclipse Maven plugin should be able to import the project directly
from the pom.xml file.

Maven installs VDMJ in the com.fujitsu group.



VDMJ includes the Apfloat library for arbitrary precision arithmetic.
