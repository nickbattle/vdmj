Things still to do with QuickCheck

1. Make getValues interruptible as well as checkObligations?
2. Move QC to be part of POPlugin(s)
3. Separate IO from calculations (and allow LSP control)
4. Make SearchQCPlugin use the "sense" of forall/exists to choose values.
5. Only process chosen POs in -fixed:create
