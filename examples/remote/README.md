## Example RemoteControl

This project contains a very simple example of how to write a RemoteControl. As the comments in
the source say:

```
/**
 * This simple example is designed to run with the Conway.vdmsl test spec in
 * src/test/resources. It demonstrates the use of the RemoteControl interface
 * to display a GUI animation of the Game of Life.
 *
 * Execute in VDM by adding the project to the classpath and passing:
 *
 *     -remote remote.Comway
 *
 * Rather than giving an interpreter prompt, this will hand control over to the
 * GUI, which displays the Game board and increments it automatially. Close the
 * GUI window to finish.
