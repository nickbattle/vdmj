VDMJ Script
===========

The VDMJ distribution contains a bash shell script, "vdmj.sh", to help you to start the command line,
including all of the relevant jar files in the distribution ZIP. To run the script, unzip the distribution
and add the extract folder to your $PATH.

PATH=$PATH:~/vdmj-suite-4.6.0-SNAPSHOT/

nick@cube:~> vdmj.sh 
Usage: vdmj.sh [-help] <VM and VDMJ options>

nick@cube:~> vdmj.sh -help
Usage: VDMJ [-vdmsl | -vdmpp | -vdmrt] [<options>] [<files or dirs>]
-vdmsl: parse files as VDM-SL (default)
-vdmpp: parse files as VDM++
-vdmrt: parse files as VDM-RT
-w: suppress warning messages
-v: show VDMJ jar version

If you are not running a bash shell, you can run VDMJ directly from Java as follows, though it would
be sensible to add this to some sort of script in your environment. For simple invocations, you can
use "-jar", which uses the MainClass defined in its manifest; for more complex invocations, that include
the other jars, you have to specify the "-cp" classpath and the main class "VDMJ":

nick@cube> java -jar vdmj-4.6.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 
You did not identify any source files

nick@cube> java -jar vdmj-4.6.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -vdmsl -i
