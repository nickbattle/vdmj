VSCode Script
=============

This VDMJ distribution includes a bash script to help you patch a VSCode installation, that
already has the VDM VSCode extension installed. The script will update the version of VDMJ
and the associated libraries to that in the distribution. This can be helpful if you want
the latest changes quickly, and cannot wait for the next VDM VSCode marketplace update.

To run the "vscode.sh" script, you must first include the installation folder (where you
unzipped the distribution) on your $PATH. For example:

PATH=$PATH:~/vdmj-suite-4.5.0-SNAPSHOT/

You can then try running vscode.sh without any arguments, which will detect the VDM VSCode
installation in the default location ($HOME/.vscode/extensions/overturetool.vdm-vscode-<ver>).

You do not have to be in any particular directory when you run the script.

If you know your VSCode installation uses a different extension location, you can pass this
as an option to the script.

nick@pollux:~> vscode.sh -help
Usage: vscode.sh [<VDM VSCode extension location>]
e.g. vscode.sh "~/.vscode/extensions/overturetool.vdm-vscode-1.3.7"

nick@pollux:~> vscode.sh 
**************************** WARNING! ****************************
