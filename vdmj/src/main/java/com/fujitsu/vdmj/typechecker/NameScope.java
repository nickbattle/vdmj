 * An enum to represent name scoping. When names are being looked up with

 * being type checked, the typeCheck method uses NameScope to indicate what names are permitted when
 * checking the content. For example, an operation would be type checked under
 * the NAMESANDSTATE scope, but when its post condition is checked, it would
 * be checked under NAMESANDANYSTATE to include the "old" names.
