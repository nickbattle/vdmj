Building VDMJ
=============

VDMJ is designed to be built with Maven (see http://maven.apache.org/).

In practice, after checking out the source, this means you just need to sit at the root
directory (where the pom.xml file is located) and run the command "mvn clean install".
This will build the VDMJ jar file in the vdmj target folder, as well as running the internal
test suite.

To prepare VDMJ for work with Eclipse, the command "mvn eclipse:eclipse" from the top
level folder will build an Eclipse project file and allow the project to be imported.
Alternatively, the Eclipse Maven plugin should be able to import the project directly
from the pom.xml file.

Maven installs VDMJ in the com.fujitsu group.

For information on a particular release, see https://github.com/nickbattle/vdmj/releases.

Running VDMJ
============

The whole of the core language is in a single jar called vdmj-<version>.jar, which is
created in the target folder by the Maven build. That can be executed directly as follows:

$ java -jar vdmj-4.4.3-SNAPSHOT-210413.jar -vdmsl -i
Initialized 1 module in 0.489 secs. 
Interpreter started
>

Additional jars are available to add standard libraries, and annotations. These are built
in the target folders of the corresponding vdmj-suite. So if the jars were all in one
locations, you could run:

$ java -cp vdmj-4.4.3-SNAPSHOT-210413.jar:annotations-4.4.3-SNAPSHOT-210413.jar \
     com.fujitsu.vdmj.VDMJ -vdmsl -annotations -i
Initialized 1 module in 0.454 secs. 
Interpreter started
> set
Preconditions are enabled
Postconditions are enabled
Invariants are enabled
Dynamic type checks are enabled
Pre/post/inv exceptions are disabled
Measure checks are enabled
Annotations are enabled
> 

But this is quite awkward, so a bash script is provided in vdmj/src/main/scripts called
"vdmsl.sh". This is intended to be used as the target of a symlink, and locates the jars
in the standard Maven build location (ie. $HOME/.m2/repository/com/fujitsu/vdmj). The
script has arguments to add annotations or the high-precision jars to the execution:

lrwxrwxrwx 1 nick users  65 Nov 30 11:41 vdmpp -> vdmj-suite/vdmj/src/main/scripts/vdmsl.sh
lrwxrwxrwx 1 nick users  65 Nov 30 11:41 vdmrt -> vdmj-suite/vdmj/src/main/scripts/vdmsl.sh
lrwxrwxrwx 1 nick users  65 Nov 30 11:41 vdmsl -> vdmj-suite/vdmj/src/main/scripts/vdmsl.sh

The script uses the symlink filename as the VDM dialect. So you can run it as follows:

$ vdmsl
Usage: /home/nick/bin/vdmsl [--help|-?] [-P] [-A] <VM and VDMJ options>
-P use high precision VDMJ
-A use annotation libraries and options
Default VM options are /usr/bin/java -Xmx3000m -Xss1m -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=localhost
  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote
$

$ vdmsl -i test.vdm
Parsed 1 module in 0.077 secs. No syntax errors
Type checked 1 module in 0.257 secs. No type errors
Initialized 1 module in 0.165 secs.
