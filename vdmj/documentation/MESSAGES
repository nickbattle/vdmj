VDMJ Error and Warning Messages
===============================

Messages and warnings are numbered in the following blocks:

0000-0999	Internal errors
1000-1999	Lexical errors
2000-2999	Syntax errors
3000-3999	Type checking errors
4000-4999	Runtime errors
5000-5999	Warnings
6000-6999	Annotation messages

Several messages appear to be duplicates, but internally they are raised from
different places in the code, and so the exact error number may be used to
distinguish the cases. Some errors are followed by additional detail, such
as the expected and actual values.
